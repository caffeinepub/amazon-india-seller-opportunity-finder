  "summary": "The implementation covers most core requirements including backend data models, filtering, category support, dashboard UI, and user profiles. However, several critical features are missing: the complete Opportunity Score algorithm implementation, keyword research backend integration, trend detection system, profit calculator, competitor analysis backend, alert system backend logic, and monetization tier enforcement. Some advanced features like AI-generated suggestions and private label scoring are also not implemented.",
