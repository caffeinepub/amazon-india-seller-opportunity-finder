  "summary": "The diff successfully implements all requested requirements. The backend adds both ASIN and productName fields to the Product type, updates mock products with valid 10-character ASINs, and ensures these fields are returned in responses. The frontend updates the Product type definition, displays the ASIN prominently with monospace styling on ProductCard, and ensures the product name is the primary heading. Migration logic is included to handle the schema change.",
